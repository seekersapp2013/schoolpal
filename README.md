The Problem We’re Solving A PLATFORM WHERE STUDENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CAN ANONYMOUSLY REVIEW SCHOOLS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT   “It is one thing to rant, it is another for us to be clear about what the shared understanding of a ‘good school’ is. Suggested scoring criteria include quality of infrastructure, faculty, effectiveness etc. The solution needs to be able to allow for anonymous reporting of issues e.g sexual harassment, extortion, method of teachers, trainers, lecturers and must be very practical and easy to scale in Nigeria.”  Our Solution will be a slack-like application that can solve the stipulated problem.
